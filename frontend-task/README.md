# Front-end task

This is a simple Hangman game (you can find PSD in [sources](/sources) directory). Can you make this stuff work?

Use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as playground (create an account and create new pen, once youâ€™re done send us link to your work). You can use any different platform or even create it using your own setup if you want but please remember that:
+ You should provide us with link to your game and it should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to play)
+ We should be able to take a look at your code :) (link to CodePen, Github, ZIP file will work perfectly for us)

### Rules & hints
1. Use real API for fetching random word. [Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/words) could be great for that.
2. There should be no folk at game beginning. Game ends once folk earns left foot (see diverted flow below).

3. You can write your game in pure JS or use framework of your choice (React, Ember or Angular preferred).
4. Using newest ECMAScript Standard is a huge plus.
5. Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions etc. (Your code is your business card)
6. You can find cropped images in images directory, but try not to use all of them (CSS power!).
7. Make use of keyboard as controller.
8. Game over screen is available in [sources](P/sources) directory.
9. Remember about users with retina screens.
